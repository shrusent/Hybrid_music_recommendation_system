# Hybrid_music_recommendation_system- Data mining project

A hybrid recommendation system using aspect-based sentiment anal- ysis can provide more personalized, accurate, and relevant recommendations to users, leading to increased engagement and sales.
The data is collected from the Spotify API, Last.fm API which is pre-processed by removing missing values. This data will be further aggregated by adding attributes from the Album of the Year API. Performed exploratory data analysis by scaling the data, and feature engineering. This can help in selecting important features required for clustering. Visualized the data using barplots, scatterplots and violin plots to understand the interdependencies between the attributes of the data.
